# Designing Prototype For Cybersecurity Course

### Problem Statement
To design an IS program with a specialization in cybersecurity that engages students and prepares them for becoming an industry professional. 
We are tasked to design and align a program curriculum with the guidance of ISACA to ensure competencies in cybersecurity. The result could create certified students, which is certainly desirable. However, the objective is to confirm that the newly designed program helps students acquire the competencies as outlined by ISACA. We describe a path for alignment of programs to develop these desirable competencies. Therefore, we need to document processes that align the Cal State LA university curriculum to industry needs, aligning the cybersecurity program to such competencies as an information systems auditor using the CISA certification. To align our curriculum to ISACA, we need to research the following: 
(1) whether students graduating from the program had acquired adequate competencies. 
(2) if not, how can the curriculum be modified to help gain the desired competencies.
